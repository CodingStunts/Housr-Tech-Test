## Thoughts and Explanation of My Final Product

I'm adding a short README before I push my final result of this tech test up.

Honestly, I'm a little disappointed with how much of it I've managed to complete in the time given.
I'd like to have had a bit more time to plot it out in the first instance before the timer started as I feel like I ended up using too much time working out what I could feasibly make in the time allowed.
I knew I would have to be very scant on styling in order to get any functionality down, but by the time I'd set up the Expo app and wire-framed a rough idea of how I'd put it together and got all the dependencies sorted I was already low on time.
I didn't get around to testing as there really wasn't enough functionality to properly test by the time I'd finished.
