## Thoughts and Explanation of My Final Product

I'm adding a short README before I push my final result of this tech test up.

Honestly, I'm a quiet disappointed with how much of it I've managed to complete in the time given.
I'd like to have had a bit more time to plot it out in the first instance before the timer started as I feel like I ended up using too much time working out what I could feasibly make in the time allowed.

I knew I would have to be very scant on styling in order to get any functionality down, but by the time I'd set up the Expo app and wire-framed a rough idea of how I'd put it together and got all the dependencies sorted I was already low on time. I had to brush up on some documents regarding setting up on a few packages.

I didn't get around to testing as there really wasn't enough functionality to properly test by the time I'd finished. Once I'd set up the invoice form I would have created tests for the invoice list retrieval and the form submission/create invoice function. Then I would have at least fleshed out the other components I had prepared in my components folder, so even if they weren't all linked up they would at least be available to view.

One thing this tech test did certainly bring to my attention is that as a junior dev for the last couple of years I've very rarely had to start up a project from scratch. It's definitely been a useful reminder to keep up to date on the setup of apps, as I've mainly done component and feature creation while I've been working and building on existing apps. I've had fun working against the clock, even if the final result I've managed isn't up to what I believe I can do on a good day.

Thanks for taking the time to view this!
